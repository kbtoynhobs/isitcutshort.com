# Is it cut short?
[Is it cut short?](https://www.isitcutshort.com/) (IsItCutShort.com) is a website that tracks TV shows that were cut short (ended prematurely or cancelled), and/or ends on a cliffhanger ending.

## Contributing
### How to contribute
Feel free to contribute shows. You can:
- post a pull request (see [data.json](https://github.com/xdpirate/isitcutshort.com/blob/main/data.json) for the data structure used, and add your show to that file)
- post an issue with the show's name for review
- shoot me an [email](mailto:webmaster@isitcutshort.com?subject=Show%20contribution) with the show's name for review

### Viable show inclusions
If a show fulfills any of these criteria, you can request it to be included:
- It was officially cancelled at *any point* during its run<br />*Example:* Futurama &mdash; Cancelled numerous times throughout its run, but has a non-cliffhanger ending

- It ends on a cliffhanger (while being officially ended, cancelled or on extended hiatus)<br />*Example:* My Name is Earl &mdash; cancelled and ends on a cliffhanger

- It ends on a cliffhanger that is resolved in a movie or other secondary work<br />*Example:* Revolution &mdash; Ended on a cliffhanger, but a comic book was released to wrap up the story

- It was ended without a cliffhanger, but more show content exists outside the show itself<br />Example: Seinfeld &mdash; Had a fictional reunion episode on Curb Your Enthusiasm

Please don't request any shows that ran from beginning to end or is currently running with none of the above criteria fulfilled &mdash; the point of the site is to list shows that have or have had trouble wrapping up their stories, or have more content in other shows.
